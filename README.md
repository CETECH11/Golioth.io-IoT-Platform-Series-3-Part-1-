Golioth is an IoT platform that provides cloud services for embedded devices. Enabling everything that our devices need from the cloud, including device messaging, security, updates, analytics, and more. Golioth is a straightforward commercial IoT development platform built for scale. Speed up development and increase the chances that your pilots will be put into production with a full featured platform of firmware, services & cloud management.
They chose the Zephyr Project™, as the basis of their first embedded offering. Zephyr is an open-source, safe, secure, and flexible RTOS under the Linux Foundation. We offer the Golioth SDK - built on top of the Zephyr SDK - which we can use to quickly bootstrap an IoT application.
